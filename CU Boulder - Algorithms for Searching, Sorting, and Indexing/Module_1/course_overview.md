### Course overview:

#### What is an algorithm?

* An Algorithm is a computational procedure (or recipe) for solving a problem we are interested in. They have inputs and they provide ouputs

What is an __Instance__ (of the problem)?

* Whenever we plug-in values for the input, we call it the instance of the problem.  

Once we have the instance of the model, the algorithm runs in a mechanical manner (there is no creativity, it is a step by step process.) The we obtain the result.
