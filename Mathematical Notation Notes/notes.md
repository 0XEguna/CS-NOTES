### Set of numbers:

#### Real Numbers: 

They are denoted by the uppercase R letter:

$$\mathbb{R}$$

The real numbers set includes the following: Rational numbers, Intergers, Irrational numbers and Trascendental numbers.

#### Rational Numbers:

Denoted by $$\mathbb{Q}$$ (coming from the latin *quotiens*), they are each number that can be represented as the quotient of two interger numbers. More exactly, they are the numbers that can be represented as the quotient of an interger and a natural positive number (that is, no 0 in the denominator as we cannot divide by 0; in general a/b = c means a = b√óc. If b is zero, then a is also zero.)

#### Natural Numbers: 

Represented by a capital
$$ \mathbb{N}$$
letter, the natural numbers are the set of numbers that can be used to count the elements of certain sets. 

Given two neighbour numbers, the one located on the right is called the *following* or *succesive* number. Therefore, this set of numbers is ordered and infinite.

The set of all natural numbers equal or less than a certain number *k*, that is, the set {1, 2, ..., k-1, k}, is called __Natural Succesion Segment__ and is denoted by [1,k] or just [k].

#### Irrational Numbers:

A value that cannot be expressed as a fraction m/n, where 

$$ m, n \in \mathbb{Z} \quad \textrm{and} \quad n \not = 0 \quad \textrm{.}$$

That is, they are any real number that is not rational and their decimal representation is neither exact or periodic. 

We use a capital I to represent them: 
$$ \mathbb{I}$$



#### Trascendental Numbers:




### Division vocabulary:

$$ a/b = c $$

* __Numerator:__  a
* __Denominator:__ b
* __Quotient:__ c

### Symbols:

__Belonging to:__

$$ \in $$

__For all:__

$$ \forall $$

For al x belonging to R:

$$\forall x \in \mathbb{R}$$
